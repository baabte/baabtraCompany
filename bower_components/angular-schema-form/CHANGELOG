 * The example now includes the tinymce add on (https://github.com/Textalk/angular-schema-form-tinymce)
 * @cameronprattedwards split the gulp tasks and tests into manageble files.
 * Fixed validation bugs with numbers and dates, this also got validation working in Angular 1.3.0
 * Placeholder on textarea
 * step="any" so a HTML5 input doesn't default to 1 and break float validation
 * Allow for a pre-existing layout where fields will be inserted, thanks @ebrehault
   Docs are missing but lock at PR #112.

v0.7.3
------
 * Fix for regression in enum order in selects, thanks @adamschwartz
 * Descriptons in fieldsets, thanks @mike-marcacci
 * Evaluate sfModel in the parent scope, thanks @mike-marcacci
 * 'defaultFormDefinition' is now exported on the schemaForm provider making it possible to create
   addons that have arbitrary forms inside them, i.e. like fieldset.
 * A couple of bugs, required should now work fine, tabarrays behave, list tags be mathed etc

v0.7.2
------
 * Add-ons now have their own repos, and there is a colorpicker!
 * 'arrayIndex' is exposed as a locals in conditionals
 * New tab in tabarrays gets focus.
 * We now follow google javscript code guidelines, policed by jscs.

v0.7.1
------
Thanks to @torstenrudolf, this release is basically his PR:s.
 * Bugfix: Array validation for Checkboxes
 * New radios type: 'radios-inline'
 * Class "control-label" added to labels

v0.7.0
------
 * Support for complex keys, at least when using Angular 1.3.
   See docs/knownlimitations.md for details. Thanks @mike-marcacci for that
   awesome PR.
 * New format for 'titleMap', it can now also take a list.
 * Checkboxes have proper two way binding.
 * Validate entire form with $scope.$broadcast('schemaFormValidate')
 * If there is no title in neither schema nor form it defaults to the property
   name from the schema.
 * 'sf-options' attribute for globals options, with an option for form defaults.
 * Added 'ng-model-options' so Angular 1.3 users can validate on blur.
 * All validation, even required is now using tv4js, change 'validationMessage'
   accordingly. This means arrays validate.
 * 'Checkbox' type implies a default of false if none is set.
 * Changed tactics when it comes to bower deps, it now only depends on what you
   cannot go without, i.e. tv4, angular, angular-sanitize and objectpath. You
   have to add bootstrap and other dependencies manually (a lot are optional).
 * Lots of small bugfixes.

 Thanks to @mike-marcacci, @sashless, @cameronprattedwards,@ianbeeston,
 @torstenrudolf and all of you who made a lot of issues and PR:s this summer!
